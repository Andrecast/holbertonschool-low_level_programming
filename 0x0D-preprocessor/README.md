## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/q8A4cA0iZZTmv_nLXVCBQw "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are macros and how to use them
-   What are the most common predefined macros
-   How to include guard your header files

## Tasks

### 0. Object-like Macro

mandatory

Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024

### 1. Pi

mandatory

Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359

### 2. File name

mandatory

Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

-   You are allowed to use the standard library
- 
### 3. Function-like macro

mandatory

Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`

### 4. SUM

mandatory

Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`
