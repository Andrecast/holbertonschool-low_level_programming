## Tasks

### 0. 0

mandatory

Write a function that converts a binary number to an  `unsigned int`.

-   Prototype:  `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
-   where  `b`  is pointing to a string of  `0`  and  `1`  chars
-   Return: the converted number, or 0 if
    -   there is one or more chars in the string  `b`  that is not  `0`  or  `1`
    -   `b`  is  `NULL`

### 1. 1

mandatory

Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

-   Prototype:  `void print_binary(unsigned long int n);`
-   Format: see example
-   You are not allowed to use arrays
-   You are not allowed to use  `malloc`
-   You are not allowed to use the  `%`  or  `/`  operators

### 2. 10

mandatory

Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

-   Prototype:  `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);`
-   where  `index`  is the index, starting from  `0`  of the bit you want to get
-   Returns: the value of the bit at index  `index`  or  `-1`  if an error occured

### 3. 11

mandatory

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to  `1`  at a given index.

-   Prototype:  `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`
-   where  `index`  is the index, starting from  `0`  of the bit you want to set
-   Returns:  `1`  if it worked, or  `-1`  if an error occurred

### 4. 100

mandatory

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to  `0`  at a given index.

-   Prototype:  `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`
-   where  `index`  is the index, starting from  `0`  of the bit you want to set
-   Returns:  `1`  if it worked, or  `-1`  if an error occurred

### 5. 101

mandatory

Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

-   Prototype:  `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);`
-   You are not allowed to use the  `%`  or  `/`  operators
