## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/I_tsvWO9Fe7IGfMrvbxw2w "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are structures, when, why and how to use them
-   How to use  `typedef`
- 
## Tasks

### 0. Django
Define a new type  `struct dog`  with the following elements:

-   `name`, type =  `char *`
-   `age`, type =  `float`
-   `owner`, type =  `char *`

### 1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself

mandatory

Write a function that initialize a variable of type  `struct dog`

-   Prototype:  `void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner);`
- 
### 2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad

mandatory

Write a function that prints a  `struct dog`

-   Prototype:  `void print_dog(struct dog *d);`
-   Format: see example bellow
-   You are allowed to use the standard library
-   If an element of  `d`  is  `NULL`, print  `(nil)`  instead of this element. (if  `name`  is  `NULL`, print  `Name: (nil)`)
-   If  `d`  is  `NULL`  print nothing.

### 3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read

mandatory

Define a new type  `dog_t`  as a new name for the type  `struct dog`

### 4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of

mandatory

Write a function that creates a new dog.

-   Prototype:  `dog_t *new_dog(char *name, float age, char *owner);`
-   You have to store a copy of  `name`  and  `owner`
-   Return  `NULL`  if the function fails

### 5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg

mandatory

Write a function that frees dogs.

-   Prototype:  `void free_dog(dog_t *d);`
